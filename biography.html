        <p class="biography">Growing up in a single-parent household shaped me into the independent, empathetic, and ambitious man I am today.
          Out of all of the lows that my family and I have been through, I think back to a situation that I couldn’t see my mother getting us out of.
          After moving back and forth from state to state, we eventually moved to Charlotte with my mother’s former husband.
          After months of them arguing and fighting they decided to separate from each other. He decided that the best way for
          them to separate would be to move some of our belongings out of the house and lock us out.
          Without any known family in Charlotte at the time we found ourselves stranded. Those next couple of months brought lessons that to this day, I still look to. </p>
