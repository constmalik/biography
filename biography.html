        <p class="biography">
          My name is Malik Robinson and I am a Tech Trainee in the Tech Program at Road2Hire. I am 21 years old and I graduated from Phillip O. Berry in 2014,
           in which I was enrolled in the Informational Technology academy. I was born in Paterson, New Jersey and moved to Charlotte at the age of 10 with my 3 siblings and mother.
          Growing up in a single-parent household shaped me into the independent, empathetic, and ambitious man I am today. While still getting used to being away from my New Jersey family,
           I began to develop a love for photography. I enjoyed capturing moments of the crazy and silly things my family did. I really enjoyed seeing what I could do when editing the pictures
         and got a thrill when getting positive feedback from family members and their friends.
